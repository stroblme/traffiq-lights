# Traffiq Lights

Simple example for using [optuna](https://optuna.org/) in conjunction with [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/).

Binary classification of scattered traffic light values (red, yellow, green) using an MLP.
Layers, their dimensionality and optimizers are evaluated with optuna.

## Usage

By now, no fancy pipeline exists.
Just create a venv, install requirements and run "traffic-lights-pytorch-optuna.py"

Tested with Python 3.8.
